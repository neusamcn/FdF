## Description

For this project, minilibX is used, which is a simple X-Window (X11R6) programming API in C, designed for students, suitable for X-beginners.

The X Window system (X11, or simply X) is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems.

X provides the basic framework for a GUI environment: drawing and moving windows on the display device and interacting with a mouse and keyboard.



## Instructions

1. Compile the project with `make` or `make all`.
2. To test for leaks and input parsing, change `MAP_NAME` in `Makefile` and run `make debug`.
